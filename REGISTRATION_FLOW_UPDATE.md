# Registration Flow Update

## New Registration Process

### 1. User Registration
- User fills registration form with reCAPTCHA verification
- Backend validates reCAPTCHA and creates user account
- OTP is generated and sent to user's email
- User is redirected to `/email-verification` page

### 2. Email Verification
- User enters 6-digit OTP received via email
- Backend verifies OTP and marks email as verified
- User is redirected to `/login` page with success message

### 3. Login Process
- User can now login with verified email
- Two-factor authentication flow (reCAPTCHA → OTP → login)

## Files Updated

### Backend:
- ✅ `userController.js` - `verifyRegistrationOtp` function already exists
- ✅ `userRoutes.js` - Added `/verify-registration-otp` route

### Frontend:
- ✅ `Register.jsx` - Redirects to email verification after registration
- ✅ `EmailVerification.jsx` - New page for registration OTP verification
- ✅ `SummaryApi.js` - Added `verifyRegistrationOtp` endpoint
- ✅ `route/index.jsx` - Added `/email-verification` route
